# HTML Attribute Folder

## IntelliJ Plugin

Annoyed with some html attributes and their length?

This simple and lightweight plugin will help you fold them, so you don't need to see them anymore. Any
template written in JSX, XML, HTML, XHTML and DTD is supported by the plugin. The plugin will not edit your real code in any way, and you can choose whether
to fold
the items by default, placeholder for folded items, and how the folding looks like.

You can find the plugin on [IntelliJ marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19715-html-attribute-folder).
